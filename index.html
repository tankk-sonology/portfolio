                (High Volumes).
                
                This sequence of samples comes from my only hardware synthesizer.
        
                It has been put together in a single experimentation session.
                
                I was analyzing how the different variables affected the output (focused on the rhythm and period of the generated sound wave).
                
                For now my knowledge in this area is rather poor.
                
                However I do see potential mathematical operations between functions and their translation into sound or music.

                In this monologue the deep voice of Laurence Fishburne set a mysterious, dark and disturbing atmosphere.
        
                The idea behind my reinterpretation was to add weight and impact to Morpheus words.
                
                I believe audio effects to be rather valuable in shaping the sound of any art work.
                
                For instance, using a distinct effect on each recording of a film soundtrack bends the perception of the piece in a unique direction and is especially useful when trying to fill unrealistic environments with sound.
                
                Words are hard to manipulate without compromising the clarity. However sound effects can mimic the meaning of a speech changing the impression it gives (or its intensity).
                
                For example multiplying the voices during an oppressive claim makes it more overwhelming,
                formant shifting the speech timbre during one’s offer makes the propose sound demonic.
                
                The audio track was taken from the film “The Matrix” released in 1999, directed by the Wachowskis.

                The world of Blade Runner speaks with no words.
        
                In this composition I focused on sound communication.
                
                The unique way each one composes and perceives sounds expands the artistic shapes of a piece in a number of ways.
                
                With this concept in mind, I tried to follow and give color to what I felt while watching.
                
                The one-semitone up echoes of the sine wave, for example, replicate the uneasiness and curiosity I experienced seeing Joi’s gaze.
                
                Even here I made wide use of sound effects, especially bit crushers.
                
                I consider this effect to be the emblem of the union between music and computers.
                
                An artifact to be avoided for some, an aesthetic sound texture for others.
                
                The video clip was taken from the film “Blade Runner 2049” released in 2017, directed by Denis Villeneuve.

                These are more than ten different recordings of the track “Motherboard” composed by Daft Punk.
        
                With the introduction of reverb units and digital reverbs, reflections and echoes are often avoided when recording for a composition.
                
                I tried to catch colorful reverberations in many different places (including the Verona Cathedral).
                
                This mix was made using only volume automations, it could have been enhanced with some equalization but I wanted to see how the arrangement of the recordings could shape the sections of a composition.
